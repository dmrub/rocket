Rocket
------

*Modern, multi-threaded and extensible web server.*

This is *not* the official release of Rocket by Timothy Farrell. This is just my personal fork of his work with some extra patches applied on top.

For the official release, see [PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/rocket/) and [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/rocket).
